    Our Art section includes fun and bright wallpaper
  to put on your phone.  Most of these wallpapers are
  drawn on a creative website, sketch.io, which I would 
  recommend to the many artists out there. I hope you 
  like our art and we encourage you to make some 
  fabulous art on your own. (:
